## Building an application using JSwings
- Adding a new car model with various attributes

## Requirements:

1. The photo image of the car is required.
2. Data validation. Some attributes of this car are unique. And some have a specific pattern. You don't have to use regex here, you can use some simple logic to do this data validation.
3. Use a table to display all service records of this car.
4. Upload your assignment onto Github. The guide of Github is attached in my first announcement -> 5100 FAQ. Submission on canvas is not acceptable.
